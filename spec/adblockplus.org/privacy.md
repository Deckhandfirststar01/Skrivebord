## General notes

Your protection and data confidentiality is of utmost importance to us; that is why we take protecting your personal data seriously. Collecting data helps our products and websites function correctly, and allows us to communicate with you. Our general privacy policy is to avoid collecting more data than necessary. Collected data is anonymized, if possible, and deleted when no longer needed. Our privacy policy will inform you about the specific data, the scope and the purpose of the collection and use of personal data by <fix>eyeo</fix> when using our products and visiting our websites. Please note that we gather and use personal data in accordance with German data protection laws.

## Who is responsible for data processing?

The legal person responsible for the collection, processing and / or use of personal data in connection with <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> ("Controller") is:

<fix>eyeo GmbH</fix>  
Lichtstr. 25  
50823 Cologne  
Germany

If you have any questions regarding your personal data, please contact us at [<fix>privacy@eyeo.com</fix>](mailto:privacy@eyeo.com)

## What is personal data?

The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also nicknames and information in your forum posts.

## Collection and processing on <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix>

When using <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix>, we automatically collect the following data in order to provide you with our services, and for security reasons:

### Website logs

All requests to <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by <fix>eyeo</fix>'s IT Security team), the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page. This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.

### Uninstallation page feedback

After uninstalling <fix>Adblock Plus</fix>, you may be directed to a webpage that asks for your feedback. The webpage anonymously stores some application and platform related data. If you decide to submit feedback, we will also store it anonymously.

### Stored IP addresses

<fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> stores your IP address when you create a forum post or add a blog comment. This allows administrators to effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored IP addresses are deleted after 30 days.

### Cookies}

Several areas of <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> use cookies to recognize signed in users or to store settings. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer with the help of your internet browser. Cookies are not evaluated in any other manner and are never used to track website visitors. If you do not want to enable cookies, you can opt against using them by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that the efficiency and range of <fix>eyeo's</fix> services may be restricted as a result.

## Information you give to us on a voluntary basis

The <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> forum and blog are both publicly available to all visitors. If you write a post or comment, we collect and process personal data as follows:

### Forum registration

We use personal data you entered during forum registration to form the user's public profile, which is visible to other forum visitors for the purpose that users can associate forum posts with a particular person.

Passwords and email addresses will not be visible to other forum visitors.
- Passwords go through one-way encryption before they are stored on the server.
- Email addresses are only displayed in the public profile if explicitly agreed to.
- By default, they are only used for the sending of notifications to which you subscribed.

**Note:** Registration is not required to participate in the forums.

### Blog comments

When you add a comment on the [<fix>Adblock Plus</fix> blog](/blog), you can optionally specify an email address. Unlike the other fields, the email address is never displayed to other visitors and is only used to notify the comment author about replies to his / her comments, if any.

## Collection and processing in <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> extensions

When you use the <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> browser extension, we collect and process the following data:

### Extension update checks

Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions including <fix>Adblock Plus</fix>. Some general information - browser version, extension version, operating system, date of last update and your IP address - are transmitted during an update check. Updates for <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Android</fix> and <fix>Internet Explorer</fix> are handled by the <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> website and the data transmitted is subject to [its privacy policy](#markdown-header-website-logs). Updates to <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Firefox</fix> are handled by the <fix>Addons.Mozilla.Org</fix> website and are subject to the [<fix>Firefox</fix> Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/). Updates to <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Chrome</fix> are handled by the <fix>Google Web Store</fix> website and are subject to the [<fix>Google</fix> Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Updates to <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Opera</fix> are handled by the <fix>Opera Add-ons</fix> website and are subject to the [<fix>Opera</fix> privacy policy](http://www.opera.com/privacy#web). Updates to <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Safari</fix> are handled by the <fix>Safari Extensions</fix> website and are subject to the [<fix>Apple Privacy Policy</fix>](https://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/).

### Subscription downloads

If you add filter subscriptions to your <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> installation, the subscription will be requested to regularly retrieve updates. Every update results in the hosting website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> version, browser and browser version. The processing of such data is not controlled by <fix>eyeo</fix> and is subject to the respective privacy terms of the provider of the website in question.

Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> domain. The data transmitted includes the <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to this [Privacy Policy](#markdown-header-website-logs).

### Issue reporter

<fix>Adblock Plus</fix> for <fix>Firefox</fix> allows you to send issue reports that will be temporarily stored on the <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> domain. These reports contain information required to investigate the issue including the <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> version, browser version, address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page, matching filters and active subscriptions. Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information. It is also possible to provide additional information on a voluntary basis, which may be privacy-sensitive:

- A website screenshot provides a scaled-down and color-reduced version of the page viewed. It is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before the report is sent.
- The email address is only used to request more information or to update the user on the issue.
- A list of installed extensions is necessary for the investigation of conflicts with other extensions.

The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique address. These addresses are only shared with the maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in the report, as <fix>EasyList</fix> authors, who are not employed at <fix>eyeo</fix>, and are unlikely to be found by others unless a link is provided. All reports and their associated data are automatically removed after 30 days.

### Emergency notification

<fix>Adblock Plus</fix> contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> installation. This feature requires all <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> installations to query an address in the <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> version, browser, browser version and the number of previous <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number). This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this [Privacy Policy](#markdown-header-website-logs).

### Further requests

<fix>Adblock Plus</fix> may make further requests to <fix>AdblockPlus.org</fix> as required. For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded. These requests are subject to this [Privacy Policy](#markdown-header-website-logs).

### Data retention

<fix>Adblock Plus</fix> stores some data in [the <fix>Firefox</fix> profile](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Profiles) on your computer. <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> never transmits this data to any servers, but other extensions and services, such as [<fix>Firefox Sync</fix>](https://mozilla.com/privacy-policy/), may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> treats this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser; this data isn't stored if you are using [private browsing mode](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Private+Browsing) and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.

## <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>Android</fix>

<fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>Android</fix> is based on <fix>Mozilla's</fix> <fix>Firefox</fix> browser. Some data collection and processing in connection with <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>Android</fix> are subject to [<fix>Mozilla's</fix> privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/). Please note that <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> automatically connects to <fix>Mozilla</fix> and its service providers to provide security, snippets and other features ([Privacy Notice <fix>Firefox</fix>](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/)); and when you ask it to, <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> also connects to <fix>Mozilla</fix> to provide you with features such as location services ([Privacy Notice <fix>Firefox</fix>](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/")).

Deviating from the description in [<fix>Mozilla’s</fix> Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/), <fix>Firefox</fix> updates are provided under <fix>eyeo's</fix> control and some features, such as the <fix>Firefox</fix> Health Report, crash reporting and add-ons, are disabled.

## <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>iOS</fix>

### Crash reporter

In the event of an unexpected crash, <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>iOS</fix> collects data relevant for analyzing the cause of the error and transmits it to <fix>eyeo's</fix> ​[<fix>HockeyApp</fix>](http://hockeyapp.net) account. The data is solely used for individual troubleshooting (as well as for identifying general defects which lead to unexpected crashes) and is never shared with any third parties other than <fix>HockeyApp</fix>.

During a crash the following data is sent:

- Bundle identifier, bundle version and short bundle version string of <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>iOS</fix>.
- Device type, CPU architecture and version of the operating system.
- Timestamp of when the crash happened.
- A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports.
- If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception.
- Low level crash data like instruction pointer, method or function names, signal data, pointer registers and information about the loaded binary images.

Said data is only collected when the application crashes. Furthermore, <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> for <fix>iOS</fix> explicitly asks for permission to send the collected information after the crash happened. All crash reports stored on our servers are removed after 30 days.

In order to learn more about <fix>HockeyApps’s</fix> privacy policy, please consult their ​[Terms of Service](http://hockeyapp.net/terms) as well as their [​documentation of collected data](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/app-management-2/what-data-is-collected-with-crash-reports).

## Email collection

Some of <fix>eyeo's</fix> webpages host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install <fix>Adblock Browser</fix> on your mobile device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email). Further, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch). In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch). We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.

## What rights do you have?

Naturally you have the right to receive, upon request, information about the personal data stored by us about you. You also have the right to correct inaccurate personal data and to block and delete details. To do so, please contact us via [<fix>privacy@eyeo.com</fix>](mailto:privacy@eyeo.com) or write to the above address.

## Deletion of your data

If we do not need your personal data any longer for the aforementioned purposes, we will delete it and it will no longer be available for further use. Please note, if data needs to be retained for legal purposes we will block the respective data.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time. The respective current version is available at: [<fix>https://adblockplus.org/privacy</fix>](https://adblockplus.org/privacy).
