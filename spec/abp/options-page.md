#### List of whitelisted domains

The [List of whitelisted domains](#list-of-whitelisted-domains) displays all whitelisted domains. Show a [Remove whitelisted domain link](#remove-whitelisted-domain-link) for each domain.

<!-- This is to technical, find a better way to describe it -->
***Note***: *All whitelisted domains* does only refer to exception rules that match the following regexp and a member of the *SpecialSubscription* filter list:

```javascript
/^@@\|\|([^\/:]+)\^\$document$/
```

#### Remove whitelisted domain link

If clicked the corresponding whitelisted domain is removed.

*NOTE: recently added has been ommitted because we don't now the date of when a domain has been whitelisted so we could only show the domains that have been added since the option page has been opened and that doesn't make any sense?!*
