Browse the web without annoying and intrusive ads.

Adblock Plus for Google Chrome blocks video ads, banners, pop-ups and other forms of intrusive and annoying advertising, as well as blocking tracking and malware.

An easy-to-use, customizable ad-blocking browser extension, Adblock Plus gives you control over your Google Chrome browsing experience. Block annoying and intrusive ads for a cleaner, better web experience. Blocking ads also reduces the risk of infection from malvertising campaigns. Users also have the option to add personal filters and whitelist websites.

Used by millions worldwide, Adblock Plus is a community-driven open source project. Hundreds of volunteers contribute daily to ensure that all intrusive ads are blocked.

Adblock Plus supports the Acceptable Ads initiative. By default, Acceptable Ads are shown, which helps support websites that rely on advertising revenue, but choose to only display nonintrusive ads. This can be disabled at any time for users who wish to block all ads. Learn more at https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads
