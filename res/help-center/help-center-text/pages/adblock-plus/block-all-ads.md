# Block all ads

If you choose to block all ads, Adblock Plus will block annoying ads *and* ads that are considered nonintrusive (Acceptable Ads). To learn more about Acceptable Ads, visit the [Acceptable Ads webpage](https://acceptableads.com/en/).

**Note**: By disabling Acceptable Ads, website owners and content creators that abide by the Acceptable Ads criteria will lose ad revenue.
