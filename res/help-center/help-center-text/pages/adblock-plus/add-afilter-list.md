# Add a filter list

Adblock Plus requires filter lists to block ads. A default filter list based on your browser's language settings is automatically activated when you install Adblock Plus. It blocks ads from the most popular (often English language-based) websites. However, it does not block ads on less popular national websites. For example, if you live in Germany you should subscribe to the national German filter list. This filter list is detected as "EasyList Germany + EasyList".

An overview of actively maintained filter lists can be found [here](https://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions).

**Tip**: As a recommendation, you should avoid adding too many filter lists to Adblock Plus. Adding too many filter lists slows down the ad blocker and, therefore, your browsing.
