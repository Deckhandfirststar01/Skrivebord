# Adblock Plus breaks the websites I visit

In rare instances, Adblock Plus may prevent some websites from functioning correctly. This is typically not a bug but rather a problem with the filters (or filter subscription).

## Temporarily disable Adblock Plus on a website

A filter list may be directing Adblock Plus to block something that should be allowed. To verify that the issue lies within the filter list, temporarily disable Adblock Plus on the website that you are experiencing the issue. If the issue is fixed after temporarily disabling Adblock Plus, you can be certain that the problem lies within the filters.
