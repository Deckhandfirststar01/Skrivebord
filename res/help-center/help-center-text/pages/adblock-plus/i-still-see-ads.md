## Verify your filter list(s)

Adblock Plus requires filter lists to block ads. A default filter list based on your browser's language settings is automatically activated when you install Adblock Plus. It blocks ads from the most popular (often English language-based) websites. However, it does not block ads on less popular national websites. For example, if you live in Germany you should subscribe to the national German filter list.

An overview of actively maintained filter lists can be found [here](https://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions).

**Tip**: As a recommendation, you should avoid adding too many filter lists to Adblock Plus. Adding too many filter lists slows down the ad blocker and, therefore, your browsing.

## Make sure the website is not whitelisted

## Turn off Acceptable Ads

## Check to see if your computer is infected with adware/malware

### What is adware?

Adware is a type of malware, short for "malicious software." It's a term generally used for software installed on your computer that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without your consent. In many cases you obtained this software without knowing it, as these applications are often bundled in other software installers.

If you still see ads after following these recommendations, please report the website(s) in the [forum](https://adblockplus.org/forum/).
