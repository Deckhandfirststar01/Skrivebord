# What are Acceptable Ads?

Acceptable Ads are nonitrusive ads that do not disrupt the content you are viewing.

The Acceptable Ads criteria was developed in 2011 as a joint effort between Adblock Plus and its community of users. When you install Adblock Plus and Adblock Browser, all nonintrusive ads are displayed by default. You can, however, disable this feature at any time and hide all ads. To do this, refer to this [article]().

To view the entire Acceptable Ads criteria, visit the [Acceptable Ads website](https://acceptableads.com/about/criteria).
